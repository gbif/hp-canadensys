# What's an IPT?


The [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit](https://github.com/gbif/ipt) – or IPT for short – is a free and open source web application for publishing biodiversity data. Developed by the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/) with the help of the biodiversity informatics community, including Canadensys, it has become the recommended way to publish biodiversity data.

The [Canadensys repository](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/) is a customized IPT that we use to publish and register all our datasets, including primary occurrence data (such as specimens), taxonomic checklists, general resource metadata, and sampling-event data. If you are interested in using this IPT for your own publication needs, see our [publication guide](https://canadensys.hp.gbif-staging.org/publish/7-step-guide/) for more details. The [User Manual](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/) developped by GBIF is also an excellent source of information.
