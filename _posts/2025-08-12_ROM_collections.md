## The Royal Ontario Museum


The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) has been welcoming visitors since 1914, and is a place where one can discover art, culture and nature from around the world and across the ages. It is one of the most comprehensive in Canada and one of the top 10 cultural institutions in all of North America. It is home to a world-class collection of more than 17 million artworks, cultural objects and natural history specimens, all of which are displayed in 40 gallery and exhibition spaces. More than a million specimens housed in the ROM natural history collections have now been documented and published on Canadensys.

## Publication of the ROM collections

Recent updates have been made to the collections on Canadensys, encompassing th publication of collections that had not previously been made available publicly, new occurrence records added to collections that were already published on the Canadensys IPT, and the enrichment of metadata for a better comprehension of the where the data come from. Significant enhancements have thus been implemented in key ROM collections representing a diverse array of organisms, and substantial efforts have been made to disseminate the invaluable biodiversity information to the most extensive audience possible.

### Botany

The [TRT](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=trt-specimens) collection, or The Green Plant Herbarium, is a comprehensive collection that houses in excess of 400,000 accessioned vascular plants, along with bryophytes, algae, pollen, seed and Quaternary collections.

The present collection has been updated on the Canadensys IPT for the second time in substantial measure. The initial publication comprised 85,764 records in 2018; this was followed by an additional update to 111,744 records in 2020, and most recently, the total has increased to 141,120 records in 2025.

<!---attention ici, ce n'est pas encore publié on a besoin du fichier de lien avant.)-->


The two families represented by the largest number of occurrences in this collection are the Rosaceae (22077 specimens) and the Cyperaceae (with 18122 specimens), with the genera *Carex* and *Crataegus* having the most representatives (more than 13 thousand specimens each!), as well as *Salix*, *Juncus*, and *Amelanchier* that represent a considerable section of the collection.
Several species of *Crataegus*, in particular *Crataegus douglasii* Lindley, are part of the most collected ones in this collection.

Among the Bryophyta (12 740 specimens), the genera the most represented are *Sphagnum*, *Dicranum*, *Brachythecium*, and *Lophozia* with between 300 and 500 specimens each.

> The oldest specimen recorded in this collection belongs a specimen identified as *Polygala paucifolia* Willdenow, a synonym of *Polygaloides paucifolia* (Willdenow) J.R. Abbott, which dates back to 1800 and was collected near the city of Toronto, Canada.

Together with material from North America and the rest of the world, the collection now contains in excess of 250,000 vascular plant specimens and 100,000 bryophyte specimens.


### Entomology

With 191,589 recorded specimens in this data set since 2024, the [ROME](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=rom-entomology) collection is the second largest published collection of the Royal Ontario Museum on the IPT. However, it remains by far the largest collection at the museum, with nearly 11 million specimens of insects, arachnids and myriapods in their cabinets. This collection's particular strengths lie in its extensive range of aquatic insects, including the orders Trichoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera (Simuliidae).

The top 5 orders represented in this collection in number of specimens are the
- Coleoptera 45804 specimens
- Hymenoptera 42220 specimens
- Lepidoptera 39664 specimens
- Diptera 27919 specimens
- Odonata 16802 specimens

Among the species that were the most collected, most of them are butterflies :
- Clouded Sulphur (*Colias philodice* Godart, 1819), Lepidoptera, 1066 specimens
- Hover Fly (*Syrphus ribesii* Linnaeus), Diptera, 976 specimens
- Common Ringlet (*Coenonympha tullia* W. H. Edwards, 1861) 913 specimens
- Orange Sulphur (*Colias eurytheme* Boisduval, 1852), Lepidoptera, 875 specimens
- Northern Crescent (*Phyciodes cocyta* (W. Kirby, 1837)), Lepidoptera, 862 specimens

> :information_source: The oldest record in this collection is of a Hide Beetle (*Trox unistriatus* Palisot de Beauvois, 1818) collected in Ontario, near Toronto, Canada.

Most of the occurrences are from North America (More than 111000 of them), but a considerable amount also come from South-East Asia and South America. In total, more than half of this collection contains specimens from Canada, mainly from Ontario, Yukon, and British Columbia.


### Herpetology

With its first publication on the IPT in 2025, the [ROMH](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=rom-herpetology) collection has made available 58233 recorded specimens in their dataset. It is represented by 35111 specimens of Amphibia and 23121 Reptilia (yes, that leaves one that is curiously undetermined between these two groups but is still cataloged).

Specimens and especially tissues of the amphibians and reptiles belong to specimens found worldwide.
The collection's strengths include the families Ambystomatidae, Hylidae, Megophryidae, Ranidae, Dicroglossidae, Iguanidae, Agamidae, Lacertidae, Colubridae and Viperidae. These are mainly from Canada, southwestern USA, northwestern Mexico, Southeast Asia and northeastern South America.


There are in total 7 orders present in this collection :
- Anura, the frogs, 26109 specimens
- Squamata, the largest order of reptiles; mostly known as lizards and snakes, 20833 specimens
- Caudata, the amphibians containing the extant salamanders, 8810 specimens
- Testudines, the turtles, 1917 specimens
- Crocodylia, you guessed it, the crocodiles, 365 specimens
- Gymnophiona, you probably did not guess it, these are worm-shaped or snake-shaped amphibians with either small eyes or no eyes, 192 specimens
- Rhynchocephalia, lizard like reptiles, 6 specimens

> :information_source: The last order is fascinating, as among the Rhynchocephalia, only a single species presently exist, the Tuatara (*Sphenodon punctatus* (Gray, 1842)), endemic to New Zealand, and for which a couple of specimens are preserved in the ROM collections.

> :information_source: The largest reptiles in this collection are the saltwater crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus* Schneider, 1801), followed by the Nile crocodile (*Crocodylus niloticus* Laurenti, 1768), both of them present in this collection, though only their skull or juveniles in ETOH are available.



### Ichthyology

An another new collection on the IPT, the [ROMI](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=romi-specimens) collection is a resource of 115074 recorded specimens of fish. With 493 families, with the Leuciscidae (freshwater ray-finned fishes) being by far the most represented, followed by the Salmonidae and Gobiidae (one of the largest fish families, and inversely small fishes), it is more than 7700 distinct species that are recorded in this collection.


> :information_source: Probably the smallest fish in this collection are represented by Trimmatom nanus (42 of them) and Pandaka pygmaea (two specimens) from the Gobiidae family, each about 1cm long. The Trimmatom nanus is even one of the world’s smallest known vertebrates.

> :information_source: On the other end of the spectrum, this collection also holds special specimens, the world record Lake Trout from Lake Athabasca, Alberta and the Canadian record Muskellunge from the Moon River, Ontario.

In its cabinets, the museum holds still over a million specimens of approximately 7000 species from all over the globe. As detailed in this collection description oon the IPT, the ROM houses the largest and most diverse collection of Canadian freshwater fishes in existence. Of the 232 known fish species in Canada, the ROM collection presently holds 212, or over 91%, and provides a critical tool for studies on disappearing wildlife. 

The top 5 most represented genera belong to :
- Coregonus, 4864 specimens
- Notropis, 4465 specimens
- Trimma, 2365 specimens
- Etheostoma, 2264 specimens
- Lepomis, 2160 specimens


Each with between 1000 to 1500 records, the most collected specimens belong to :
- Cisco (*Coregonus artedi* Lesueur, 1818), 1494 specimens
- White Sucker (*Catostomus commersonii* (Lacepède, 1803)), 1301 specimens
- Yellow Perch (*Perca flavescens* (Mitchill, 1814)), 1090 specimens
- Lake Whitefish (*Coregonus clupeaformis* (Mitchill, 1818)), 1004 specimens


> :information_source: The oldest preserved specimen of fish in this collection dates back to 1857, of *Salmo salar* in Lake Ontario, from the Salmonidae family. This one is a special salmon as it is the oldest of the last Alantic Salmon specimens from Lake Ontario before their extirpation in the 1850.


> :information_source: Not the oldest specimens, but probably the oldest living ones, there are also two specimens of coelacanth (*Latimeria chalumnae* Smith, 1939), an ancient group of lobe-finned fish that are more related lungfish and tetrapods than actual to ray-finned fish, and which were collected from the Comoros Islands.


The specimens of this collection were recorded accross the water bodies of the world, from all continents, event Antarctica (mainly in the South Orkney Islands) ! Canadian fish are the top represented specimens (more than 52000 of them), but interestingly, the most records per country are then Guyana, followed by Palau, a small archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean, then the USA and the Fiji with between 3000 and 8000 specimens from each country.


### Invertebrate zoology

The [ROMIZ](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=romiz-specimens) collection has its very first publication now ! This collection has never been published elsewhere before, and is now presenting 74,082 occurrence of of invertebrates.

The strength of this collection lies in its rich variety of specimens from several fascinating groups of animals:
which include
- Cnidaria -- This group includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals, best known for being often translucent and their stinging cells used for capturing prey.
- Platyhelminthes -- Commonly called flatworms, these simple but diverse animals can be found in oceans, freshwater, and even moist land environments. Some are free-living, while others are parasites.
- Annelida -- These are segmented worms like earthworms and marine polychaetes. These animals play important roles in ecosystems by recycling nutrients and aerating soils or sediments.
- Mollusca -- This is the second-largest animal phylum after Arthropoda', A hugely. This diverse group includes snails, clams, squids, and octopuses. Mollusks are vital to many ecosystems and have long captured human interest with their shells and unique behaviors.
- Astacidea -- The crayfishes, which are important freshwater crustaceans, particularly in North America, where they are both ecologically and economically significant.


The most represented specimens are:
- the ubiquitous peaclam (*Pisidium casertanum* (Poli, 1791))
- the northern clearwater crayfish (*Orconectes propinquus* (Girard, 1852))
- leeches (*Erpobdella punctata* (Leidy, 1870))
- the virile crayfish (*Orconectes virilis* (Hagen, 1870)) 
- oligochaete worms (*Lumbricillus tuba* (Müller, 1774)).

While this collection covers a wide range of species, its primary geographic emphasis is on the Western Hemisphere. There is a particular strength in specimens from Ontario and other parts of Canada, offering a detailed look at the local aquatic life in these regions.
Beyond Canada, the collection also highlights the western North Atlantic Ocean, home to diverse marine ecosystems, and extends its reach into the vast and varied waters of the North and South Pacific. This broad scope allows researchers to study patterns of biodiversity, adaptation, and environmental change across multiple aquatic habitats.



### Mammalogy

Another new collection on the IPT is the [ROMM](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=romm-specimens) collection ! You can now have access to 124,208 records of taxonomically comprehensive and worldwide specimens of mammals. These specimens are particularily from Ontario, Central America, South America, Africa and southeast Asia. Within most of these areas, collections of chiroptera and rodentia are significant. Frozen tissues are also substantial for tropical small mammals.
Mainly tiny mammals from the Chiroptera (with an astonishing 63 thousand of them!) and Rodentia orders, with strength also in an another order of small mammals, the Eulipotyphla, but also emblematic ones from the Carnivora, larger ones from the Artiodactyla order (probably preys to the previously mentionned order), and from the Lagomorpha for which The snowshoe hare is he main representative in this particular section of the collection.

> :information_source: Fun fact, the earliest occurrence of this collection is a Pacific Shrew (*Sorex pacificus* Coues, 1877), which was recorded in 1658 ! Pretty close to the second oldest record, a Northern Four-eyed Opossum (*Philander vossi* Brisson, 1762) which occurred in 1664. These are probably some of the very oldest specimens in the presented collections.


> :information_source: Another fun fact, the largest mammals in this collection must be the four giraffes ! Two of them beeing the Masai Giraffe (*Giraffa camelopardalis* subsp. *tippelskirchi* Matschie, 1898). This one has particular leaf shaped spots on its fur, and is the national animal of Tanzania. It is also the tallest land animal, weighing almost 1,300 kilograms and reaching a height of up to 5.5 metres.





### Mycology
The [TRTC](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=trtc-specimens) collection, or Royal Ontario Museum Fungarium and originally under the name of “The Cryptogamic Herbarium”, experienced a remarkable period of growth and expansion since its first creation in 1887 and incorporation in the ROM collections in 1996. Its present holding is now estimated to be about half a million specimens.
This collection holds approximately 1000 type specimens that have been sourced from private herbaria, University of Toronto and ROM scholars' fieldwork, and local amateurs. Its present holdings make it one of the largest and most significant fungal repositories in North America.


The latest update of this collection brought the total number of documented occurrences from 11,129 to an impressive jump to 99,682 occurrences in three years of collection management efforts. This update is the first large increase in number of specimens since its publication on the Canadensys IPT.

By far, the Basidiomycota (60782 records) and the Ascomycota (31915 records) are the most repreented phylums in this collection. There is also an impressive number of families represented, as 449 distinct families are recorded throughout the dataset, for more than 19000 distinct species. By far, the Pucciniaceae (10122 occurrences) were the most collected, but the species with the most records belong to *Coleosporium solidaginis* (Schw) Thum., Coleosporiaceae. This is a species from a taxonomically challenging genus of fungal plant pathogen that typically alternate between pines and angiosperms.

> :information_source: The diversity of fungi is exceptionnal, but most of them do not have a precise vernacular name, making "fungus" and "mushroom" the most used vernacular names in the dataset even though an identification to the species is determined.

Approximately half of the occurrence in this dataset come from Canada but USA, Germany, Mexico, Kenya, are also in the top 5 countries from which these fungi were collected. North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, South America and Australia are all represented in this collection.

Almost 1400 of the specimens date back to the 19th century. The oldest, from Austria and Germany, date to 1800 and were identified as *Calosphaeria princeps* Tul. & C. Tul, *Calosphaeria minima* Tul. & C. Tul. and *Sporormia obliquisepta* Speg.


### Ornithology

The [ROMO](https://data.canadensys.net/ipt/resource?r=rom-ornithology) is the largest dataset of digitized specimens from the ROM collections on the IPT!
This considerable collection contains 203284 recorded specimens, including significant historical collections such as those by James Henry Fleming (once considered the most comprehensive private collection of birds in North America), James A. Munro (also considered historically significant), and Hoyes Lloyd. It also contains part of the Haverschmidt Collection from the Guyanas and the R.G. Lanning and H.B. Haugh Collections of birds' eggs from southern Ontario.

One of the world’s top 10 collections of Birds of Paradise and Bowerbirds is held this collection. These stunning birds, known for their vibrant plumage and elaborate courtship displays, are part of the Fleming Collection — a truly remarkable resource for researchers and bird lovers alike.

This collection also includes impressive numbers of:
- New World Sparrows (Passeriformes: Emberizidae)
- North American Wood Warblers (Passeriformes: Parulidae)
- Shorebirds, Gulls, and Auks (Charadriiformes)
- Chicken-like birds such as grouse and quail (Galliformes)
- Vireos and their relatives (Vireonidae)

The study skin archive also holds one of the largest global collections of extinct birds. Highlights include:
- 132 specimens of the extinct Passenger Pigeon, presumed extinct since 1914
- A rare Labrador Duck (only 54 mounted skins known worldwide!) of which the last sighting occured in 1878
- A Great Auk (only 78 known mounted skins globally), extinct in the mid-19th century
- 14 Carolina Parakeets, once native to the U.S. and the only indigenous parrot within its range, extinct in 1939. 
- The legendary New Zealand Huia, famous for its striking beak differences between males and females

There’s also a rich historical series of Hawaiian Honeycreepers (many now endangered or extinct), collected between the 1840s and early 1900s, as well as iconic Darwin’s finches from the Galápagos Islands.

In the frozen tissue collection, researchers have access to the largest collection of blood and DNA samples from endangered kiwi birds in New Zealand. It even includes DNA and bone from the 14 extinct species of giant moas, once endemic to New Zealand as well, and may have been the tallest bird that ever lived.

And there’s more: vast numbers of owls, flycatchers, and sparrows from the Americas, making this an essential hub for avian research.



### Invertebrate and Vertebrate Palaeobiology

These are still in the process of being digitized and published openly to all !
With their great age, they can take all their time in the world.




# In short

Collections like this are essential for understanding the incredible diversity of life in our waters, in the soil, and above ground. They serve as a foundation for scientific research, conservation efforts, and education. By studying these specimens, scientists can track changes in species populations, discover new species, and better protect aquatic ecosystems.

Whether you’re a student, a researcher, or just a curious nature lover, the story told by these creatures—from the shimmering jellyfish drifting in the ocean, to the almost invisible fungi, to the most flamboyant birds in remote areas — is a fascinating glimpse into the rich tapestry of life on earth.
