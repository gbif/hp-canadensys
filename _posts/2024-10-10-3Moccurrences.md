# Celebrating a Milestone: 3 Million Occurrences on the Canadensys IPT!


We are thrilled to announce that the Canadensys IPT has hit a new milestone: 3 million specimen occurrences in our database! With 127 resources currently available, we’ve reached a total of 3,423,302 occurrences, encompassing 57,436 taxa and 10,005 unique observations. This achievement reflects the dedication of our contributing institutions, curators, and the entire biodiversity community who work tirelessly to make these data accessible.

Each new record brings us closer to understanding Canada's rich biodiversity, and beyond our borders. These occurrences represent invaluable data points that help researchers, conservators, and the public gain insights into species distribution, habitat use, and the effects of environmental changes.

As we move forward, we are committed to further expanding our database and enhancing data quality. Here’s to the next million, and a huge thank you to everyone who has helped us reach this remarkable milestone!
