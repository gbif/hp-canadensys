Since September 2024, we welcome a new member as part of the Canadensys team, **Marion Leménager**, who recently took up the position as data manager of the Canadensys IPT.

She recently obtained her Ph.D. at the University of Montréal, focusing on plant evolution and floral morphology. Her thesis was dedicated to better understanding the floral shape variation among specialized and generalized pollination strategies, and their impact on plant diversification. She also gained experience in collection management during two years in the Entomological department of the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution prior to completing her doctorate in Plant Sciences. 

**Carole Sinou**, former data and node manager, has recently taken the role of the [Marie-Victorin Herbarium](https://irbv.umontreal.ca/research/collections/marie-victorin-herbarium-mt/) coordinator. She will continue to work for the Canadensys network as node manager, taking care of the relations with the other North American nodes and the GBIF network, as well as the maintenance of the informatic infrastructure (website and tools).
